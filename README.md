The code comes from different places:  
- `LearnWebCode` a YouTube channel where I got >90% of the code. [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR25JoybTxo) and [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eddzBlXBl3Y&ab_channel=LearnWebCode)
- `Developer Handbook` a [website](https://developerhandbook.com/webpack/configure-webpack-4-hmr-scratch/) with an example **webpack.config.js**
- `StackOverflow` goes without saying ([here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37736419/can-i-hot-serve-index-html-with-webpack-dev-server)).
